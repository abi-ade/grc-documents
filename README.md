Enterprise GRC Policies & Risk Management

Scenario

PiggyCo is a fictional fintech startup that creates web and mobile applications designed to help small businesses crowdfund to scale their operations. Initially, their business model did not gain much traction. However, the endorsement of their product by a prominent influencer sparked significant interest, attracting attention from new customers and investors in the private sector.

During negotiations with potential investors, a common request was to provide cybersecurity governance documents. Investors needed this information to assess their risk and requested to see policies, procedures, risk assessments, and audit reports. Unfortunately, PiggyCo was at an ad-hoc stage in their risk management journey, lacking governance documents and awareness about the importance of risk management. They addressed risks on the fly.

Recognizing the missed investment opportunities, the company's Executive Leadership team decided to implement a proper Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) program. Unable to afford big-name consulting firms, they sought recommendations for a reputable private consultant. This led to my services being retained, referred by another startup for whom I had set up a cybersecurity governance program.
